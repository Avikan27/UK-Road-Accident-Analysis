# UK Road Accident Analysis

This project presents a visual representation of road accidents that occurred in the UK during the 2021-22 period. The objective is to create a Road Accident Dashboard providing insights into various key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends related to road accidents.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- To create a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 to gain insights on the following requirements:
  - Primary KPIs: Total Casualties and Total Accidents for the current year with YoY growth comparison.
  - Primary KPIs: Total Casualties by Accident Severity for the current year with YoY growth comparison.
  - Secondary KPIs: Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for the current year.
  - Monthly trend comparison of casualties between the current year and the previous year.
  - Casualties by Road Type for the current year.
  - Current Year Casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night.
  - Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location.

## Power BI Functionalities
This project utilizes various Power BI functionalities, including:
- Connecting to raw data/flat file.
- Data cleaning using Power Query.
- Data processing and modeling.
- Utilizing Time Intelligence functions and Calendar Date Table in Power BI.
- Establishing relationships between multiple tables for effective data modeling.
- Calculating Year-to-Date (YTD) and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth using DAX.
- Generating KPIs and advanced KPIs.
